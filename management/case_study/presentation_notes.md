# Presentation Notes

## Slide 1

- Can live for 15 years
- Grow up to 12 inches or just over a foot
- Spawn from August to November
- Feed -> Spawn -> Overwinter
- Forage Fish

## Slide 2

- Discrete spawning aggregations
- Lay beds of eggs several centimeters thick
- Eggs hatch in 7 to 10 days but experience loads of predation pressure
- Overwinter in coasts and estuaries 
- By spring they are juveniles which can get caught as sardines
- Massive mortality in general
- Spawning honing

## Slide 3

- Loads of predators besides humans
- Fin whales, tuna, harbor seals, spiny dogfish all being examples
- We'll get to more of this later

## Slide 4

- Eat em tinned, filleted, smoked, and pickled - $4 - $8 ~200g
- Competes with sardines from the rest of the world
- Also used as bait - most of which goes to catching lobsters in the NE - $1 - $3 per lb
- Marketed for their health oils and protein

## Slide 5

- Loads of ways to catch them (historically was done with weirs)
- Currently Western Atlantic herring are caught primarily with seins and midwater trawls
- Really no size limits (large ones become onwater factories)
- Most landings come from a small number of boats

## Slide 6

- Divided up into 3 areas and two subareas. 
- Each area has specific limits
- See notes on slide

## Slide 7

- The ASMFC is responsible for managing but given most of the fishing happens in new england they work closely with the NEFMC. Then NOAA provides resources for science, monitoring (trawls) and enforcement at sea (coastal enforcement is done by each state)

## Slide 8

- Just follow spark notes

## Slide 9 

- So here's the problem
- in 1970 we had a crash
- then a recovery 
- and then out of nowhere a crash
- Turns out there's been a retrospective pattern
- And that we consistently overestimate stock biomass
- Already we have to bump M up by 50% of what would be used normally to remove the retrospective pattern
- In recent years this has gotten even worse

## Slide 10

- Dive into the discrepancy even more in M
- They are using age dependent mortality scaled up a bit

## Slide 11

- There's a lot of variance in the consumption by predators
- They go through their own boom bust cycles
- And many are themselves fished
- Treating them as a fishery allows us to model M from consumption more closely rather than trying to close the gap with a constant factor

## Slide 12

- Spatial separation into distinct units
- It's entirely possible we are overfishing some units while missing out on others
- If you had multiple fish you wouldn't fish them as a single stock

## Slide 13

- So fish them as multiple stocks with multiple fisheries
